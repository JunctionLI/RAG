Nobita and Doraemon: The Dragon Quest
Once upon a time in Tokyo, Nobita was sitting in his room, bored as usual. He had just failed another math test and was sure his mom was going to scold him. Sighing, he looked up at Doraemon, who was relaxing on his bean bag.

"Can't we go somewhere exciting?" Nobita asked.

Doraemon blinked. "Exciting? Like where?"

"Somewhere with knights and castles... and dragons!" Nobita said with a grin.

Doraemon smiled and pulled out a gadget from his pocket. "This is the Fantasy World Door. It will take us to a magical world full of adventures."

Without hesitation, they stepped through the door—and landed in a medieval kingdom.

The sky was orange with twilight, and a castle loomed in the distance. Villagers were screaming and running from a terrible creature in the sky: a giant red dragon with glowing eyes and wings as wide as rooftops.

“The dragon has returned!” one villager cried. “It’s burning everything!”

Nobita gulped. “Uh… maybe we came at the wrong time?”

Doraemon pulled out another gadget. “Don’t worry. This is the Dragon Slayer Suit. With this and my gadgets, we can do anything!”

He handed Nobita a glowing sword and a shimmering armor. Doraemon himself put on a cape that allowed him to fly.

They flew toward the dragon, who had perched on top of the mountain, guarding a golden egg.

The battle was fierce. The dragon breathed fire, but Doraemon used his Anywhere Shield to protect them. Nobita, though clumsy at first, grew more confident. He remembered all the video games he’d played and followed Doraemon’s instructions closely.

At the final moment, Nobita jumped high and struck the dragon's chest with the glowing sword. A bright light exploded, and the dragon gave a final roar before vanishing into sparks.

The villagers cheered. “You saved us! Nobita the Brave and Doraemon the Wise!”

Blushing, Nobita looked at Doraemon. “We really did it.”

Doraemon smiled. “You just needed a little courage. And maybe a few gadgets.”

Back in their room, Nobita looked at the test paper again. “Maybe I can slay this math test next…”
